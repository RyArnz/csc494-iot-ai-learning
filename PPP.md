# 1. Problem

## What problem am I solving?

- Multiple paid cloud services
- Data spread across platforms
- Privacy concerns
- Limited customization

## Why important?

- Lower cost
- More control
- Private + secure
- Hands-on systems learning

---

# 2. Project Focus (Team / Topic)

## Software-focused infrastructure project

Using home server hardware to build:

- Self-hosted applications
- Personal cloud storage
- Media management
- Secure remote access
- Monitoring & automation

Category:
**Home automation + server infrastructure**

---

# 3. Two Learning Topics (with AI)

## Software Topic
### Docker & Linux Server Administration
- containers
- service orchestration
- networking
- reverse proxy configuration

## Hardware Topic
### Server Monitoring & IoT Integration
- sensors (temps/health)
- ESP32 → server communication
- system telemetry

AI assists learning & troubleshooting

---

# 4. Time Usage Plan

## Iteration 1 → Learn
- Ubuntu Server basics
- Docker fundamentals
- networking & proxy concepts
- security practices

## Iteration 2 → Build
- Deploy Nextcloud
- Configure remote access
- Add monitoring tools
- Organize media services

Learn → then implement
