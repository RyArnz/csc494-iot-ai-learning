# Learning with AI – Smart Home Media System
CSC 494 – Learning with AI Companion Repository

## Team Members

Ryan Arnzen

This is an individual learning repository that supports the Smart Home Media System project.

---

## Project Description

This repository documents how AI tools are used to support learning and development during the Smart Home Media System project.

Instead of using AI to automatically build the system, AI is used as a study assistant, tutor, and troubleshooting aid to better understand Linux servers, Docker, networking, and infrastructure concepts.

The goal is to improve technical knowledge while completing the project independently.

---

## Problem Domain

Building a home server requires knowledge across multiple areas:

- Linux system administration
- networking and remote access
- Docker containerization
- security practices
- monitoring and troubleshooting

These topics can be difficult to learn simultaneously. AI can help by:

- explaining unfamiliar concepts
- breaking down problems
- suggesting approaches
- helping debug errors
- accelerating research

This repository tracks how AI supports that learning process.

## Features and Requirements

### Features

- AI-assisted explanations of technical topics
- Step-by-step troubleshooting help
- Architecture planning guidance
- Configuration examples and learning notes
- Experiment logs and reflections

### Requirements

- All implementations completed manually by me
- AI used only for learning and guidance
- Clear documentation of what was learned
- Organized notes and artifacts

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Educational focus
- Clear documentation
- Easy to follow and organized
- Reproducible learning steps

---

## Data Model

This repository contains:

- notes and summaries
- learning logs
- configuration experiments
- troubleshooting steps
- reflections on AI assistance
- screenshots or examples

(No production system data is stored here.)

---

## Architecture

High-level workflow:

Problem → Ask AI for explanation → Research → Implement manually → Test → Document results

AI acts as a learning assistant, not as an automated developer.

---

## Tests

### Acceptance Tests
- Concepts understood and applied successfully
- Configurations work without copying blindly
- Able to explain solutions independently

### Integration Tests
- Learning directly improves system implementation

### E2E Tests
- Problem encountered → AI guidance → manual fix → working system

---

## Project Documentation

- Topic summaries
- Step-by-step guides
- Troubleshooting notes
- Learning reflections
- Links to related commits in the main project

---

## Learning with AI Integration

AI will be used to learn and explore:

- Ubuntu Server administration
- Docker and containers
- networking and proxies
- server security and hardening
- monitoring and logging
- system design best practices

For each topic, I will:

1. Ask AI for explanations or examples  
2. Study the concept  
3. Implement it manually  
4. Test it  
5. Document what I learned  

This ensures understanding rather than dependence on AI-generated solutions.
